   ```bash
   cd ../Univibe_Student
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of each component and add the following environment variables:

   For the backend:
   ```env
   MONGO_URL=<your-mongodb-url>
   DB_NAME=<your-database-name>
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=<your-jwt-secret-key>
   JWT_REFRESH_SECRET_KEY=<your-jwt-refresh-secret-key>
   JWT_ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=<your-jwt-admin-secret-key>
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your-cloudinary-cloud-name>
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your-cloudinary-api-key>
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your-cloudinary-api-secret>
   ```

   For the faculty admin panel:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API=<your-backend-api-url>
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your-cloudinary-cloud-name>
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your-cloudinary-api-key>
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your-cloudinary-api-secret>
   ```

   For the student panel:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API=<your-backend-api-url>
   ```

4. Start the server for each component:

   For the backend:
   ```bash
   cd Univibes/Univibe_Backend
   npm start
   ```

   For the faculty admin panel:
   ```bash
   cd ../Univibe_Faculty
   npm start
   ```

   For the student panel:
   ```bash
   cd ../Univibe_Student
   npm start
   ```

The backend server will start on port 8000 by default, and the faculty admin panel and student panel will start on port 3000 by default.
